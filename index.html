<h1 id="different-data-visualizations-with-examples">DIFFERENT DATA
VISUALIZATIONS WITH EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Human brain processes faster visual information than text or numbers.
That is why graphical representation of data has been so popular the
last decates. In this article we are going to sum up and give some
example of the most common graphs and when we can use them.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-your-data">UNDERSTANDING YOUR DATA</h1>
<p>When you have a data set and want to analyze it in order to uncover
patterns and trends or tell a story, the first thing that you have to do
is to understand and clean your data. That means that you have to check
first if your data are reliable. Meaning, are there any mispellings, or
duplicates or missing values? Are the types of different variables
correct? When you check and correct everything that doesnâ€™t fit to your
data, you are ready to go to the next step and visualize them. But
before that, make sure that you know how each type is used for. In this
post we are going to explain some types of data visualizations and when
is proper to use them.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-data-visualizations">TYPES OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS</h1>
<p>The most common types of data visualizations are:</p>
<h2 id="bar-charts-">BAR CHARTS :</h2>
<p><img
src="images/2c5222ae-bb95-428b-89be-a32ca2ef6de4.png"
alt="bar plot.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/hotel-booking-demand-clean-data-basic-analysis">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use it when we want to compare categories or groups. When you
have discrete values and you want to see the differences between them,
bar charts is a clean and easy way to do it.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>Which item was sold most this year from our e-shop.</li>
<li>How many pageviews we had from January to July.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stacked-bar-charts--compare-with-two-relative-variables">STACKED
BAR CHARTS : COMPARE WITH TWO RELATIVE VARIABLES</h2>
<p><img
src="images/a045ad9c-f582-4e81-9026-cb458a0336b9.png"
alt="stackedbar chart.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/online-shopping-eda-for-beginners">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use a stacked bar when we want to look at numeric values not
for one categorical variable but two. Therefore, if we care about the
relative decomposition of each primary bar based on the levels of a
secondary categorical variable.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>Visualize the monthly savings and spendings for every month.</li>
<li>See which gender bought more items from a product this year.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="grouped-bar-charts-">GROUPED BAR CHARTS :</h2>
<p><img
src="images/524bfc69-3ee8-4e73-a09c-3e83c7120cef.png"
alt="grouped bar charts.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/customer-personality-analysis-eda-clustering">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use a grouped bar chart when we want to observe two or more
data sets displayed side-by-side and grouped together under categories
on the same axis.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to compare the income of your company for the first
semester of the last 3 years.</li>
<li>Compare the salary of a job for different companies depending on the
experience of the position.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="line-charts--see-trends">LINE CHARTS : SEE TRENDS</h2>
<p><img
src="images/c836f151-75d1-46e8-9040-c922d9573df9.png"
alt="line chart.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/online-shopping-eda-for-beginners">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use it to observe data over time. They are perfect for
continuous data and for showing how a variable can change at equal
intervals.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to see the number of sales of a product over time (days,
months, years). Or to compare more than one product over time.</li>
<li>See how many visitors came on an event, the first eight hours of an
exhibition and which hour of the day had the least attendance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pie-charts--showcasing-proportions">PIE CHARTS : SHOWCASING
PROPORTIONS</h2>
<p><img
src="images/8bf805dc-913a-41fc-a21b-8fa2b718f7ce.png"
alt="pie chart.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/hotel-booking-demand-clean-data-basic-analysis">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use it when we want to see how parts make up a whole. They are
a good way when you want to illustrate propotional data and the total of
your segments is 100%.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>How much from our annual salary was spent in different categories
(groceries, clothes, entertainment etc.)</li>
<li>How many customers prefer e-shop, app or physical shop to buy our
product.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scatter-plots--uncovering-relationships">SCATTER PLOTS :
UNCOVERING RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p><img
src="images/ba1387e3-873c-4425-b2c4-e410c2804b11.png"
alt="income_vs_spending.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/customer-personality-analysis-eda-clustering">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use it when we want to observe if there is a relationship or
correlation between two variables. They are perfect for visualizing
patterns, concentrations and outliers.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to see if height and age of a child are correlated.</li>
<li>See the amount of production of a product against the respective
price of it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="histograms--understanding-distributions">HISTOGRAMS :
UNDERSTANDING DISTRIBUTIONS</h2>
<p><img
src="images/43677ee2-51ba-45ea-8ae8-69ef90b41852.png"
alt="Age Distribution.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/titanic-prediction-of-death">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use it when we want to understand the distribution of our
data. They are excellent if we want to see the frrequency of data points
within certain ranges.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to observe few stocks and the frequency of the prices.</li>
<li>We have the waiting time of the customer at the cash counter of a
bank branch during peak hours.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="heat-maps--showing-variations-in-density">HEAT MAPS : SHOWING
VARIATIONS IN DENSITY</h2>
<p><img
src="images/cd573a3e-ec25-403e-ba6f-52e1c549defa.png"
alt="heatmap.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/titanic-prediction-of-death">here</a>)</p>
<p>We can use it when we have complex data sets and want to show
variations in density or intensity.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>Visualize organizational structure, revenue breakdowns, market
segmentations, and other factors over a certain period of time.</li>
<li>Compare the sales numbers of different brands or models over a
certain period.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="treemaps--use-for-hierarchical-data">TREEMAPS : USE FOR
HIERARCHICAL DATA</h2>
<p>A treemap is a chart type used to display hierarchical data through
rectangles that decrease their size as the value decreases.</p>
<p>We can use treemaps when we have hierarchical data or we do not need
a precise comparison betweeen categories.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>How many visitors went to different museums in a city.</li>
<li>In a pet shop how many customers bought different types of
pets.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bubble-charts--for-quick-comparizon">BUBBLE CHARTS : FOR QUICK
COMPARIZON</h2>
<p>A bubble chart is a chart type that represents variables using bubble
sizes, colors and positions.</p>
<p>We can use bublle charts when we want to compare data quickly and
easily. They are particularly useful when comparing data points with
multiple data sets, such as demographic data with age, gender and
occupation as variables.</p>
<p>Although bubble charts are great for comparing our data more than 20
bubbles on the chart can be confusing and overwhelming.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare a few movies and how many 5-star ratings they had in a
critic page.</li>
<li>How many followers a shop has in different social media
platforms.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="box-plot--visualizing-distribution-of-data">BOX PLOT :
VISUALIZING DISTRIBUTION OF DATA</h2>
<p><img
src="images/5a433bf6-1b4d-49dc-94cd-6300dd49d22a.png"
alt="box plot chart.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/online-shopping-eda-for-beginners?scriptVersionId=159331440">here</a>)</p>
<p>Boxplots are drawn as a box with a vertical line down the middle, and
has horizontal lines attached to each side. A box plot is a standardized
way of displaying the distribution of a data set based on the
five-number summary of data points: the minimun, first quartile (Q1),
median, third quartile (Q3) and maximum. They can also tell you if there
are outliers, if the data are symmetrical, how tightly your data is
grouped and how your data is skewed.</p>
<h2 id="area-chart--showning-trends-over-time">AREA CHART : SHOWNING
TRENDS OVER TIME</h2>
<p><img
src="images/2742db23-6c6d-48c5-8a96-95155636c3f8.png"
alt="area chart.png" /></p>
<p>(You can find the analysis that the above chart was used <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritaaggelou/online-shopping-eda-for-beginners?scriptVersionId=159331440">here</a>)</p>
<p>Area chart is a visual representation of data that utilizes both
lines and filled areas to convey information. This type of chart is
particulary effective in showcasing data trends and variations over a
specified period or accross different categories.</p>
<p>We can use area charts to show differing trends over time. It is best
to use when there is data expressed as total, there are time periods to
compare, you want to communicate an overall trend, not individual values
or there are multiple data series with part-to-whole relationships, or
cummulative series of values.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>When we want to observe the number of sales for different payment
methods per month.</li>
<li>Observe how population grows over time in different countries.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="funnel-chart--tracking-the-flow-of-visitors">FUNNEL CHART :
TRACKING THE FLOW OF VISITORS</h2>
<p>The funnel chart takes its name from its shape, which starts from a
broad head and ends in a narrow neck. They are most often used in
business or sales context, where we need to track how a starting set of
visitors or users drop out of a process or flow.</p>
<p>It is best to use it when we have at least 3 stages. Only use it when
you are sure that the number of users, customers, or any other data type
in the first step will be larger than the data values in the final step.
Otherwise a simple pie chart or a single stacked bar will do the
work.</p>
<p>Examples :</p>
<ol>
<li>How many emails we sent to our customers, how many saw them, how
many clicked on the link and how many stayed more than a minute in our
page.</li>
<li>How many applicants applied for a job, how many selected for an
interview, how many got to the second interview and how many where in
the final selection.</li>
</ol>
